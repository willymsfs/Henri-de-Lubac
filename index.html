                <h3>The Man and His Moment: Setting the Stage</h3>
                <p>To understand Henri de Lubac (1896-1991 ), we must first understand his world. The French Jesuit's thought was forged in a crucible of intellectual and spiritual crisis, defined by three major forces:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Crisis of Modernity:</strong> An era grappling with aggressive secularism and atheistic humanism.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Grip of Neo-Scholasticism:</strong> A rigid, defensive theology struggling to answer modern questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Call for Renewal:</strong> A deep yearning for a return to the authentic sources of Christianity—the Scriptures and the Church Fathers, a movement known as <em>ressourcement</em>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>His experience in the French Resistance further solidified his conviction that the Church must engage the world, not hide from it.</p>

                <h3>Core Theological Insights: A Systematic Explanation</h3>
                
                <div class="idea">
                    <h4>1. The Unbreakable Bond: Nature and the Supernatural</h4>
                    <p>De Lubac challenged the dominant "pure nature" theory, which proposed a two-tiered reality where grace was merely an optional add-on to a self-contained human nature. Instead, he revived the ancient concept of the <strong><em>desiderium naturale</em></strong>—the innate, natural desire for God written into the very fabric of our being. Grace, while a free gift, is the answer to a question that humanity <em>is</em>. This insight dismantled the wall between the sacred and the secular, profoundly influencing the Vatican II document <em>Gaudium et Spes</em>.</p>

                    <h4>2. The Church as a Rich Tapestry: A Layered Reality</h4>
                    <p>He saw the Church as a <em>complexio oppositorum</em> (a complex of opposites): at once the historical "People of God," the spiritual "Mystical Body of Christ," and the "Sacrament of Unity." In his masterwork, <em>Corpus Mysticum</em>, he demonstrated that the Eucharist is what <em>makes</em> the Church, placing the sacrificial meal at the absolute center of its identity. This layered vision shaped the council's primary document on the Church, <em>Lumen Gentium</em>.</p>

                <div class="idea">
                    <h4>3. Scripture and History: Returning to the Sources (<em>Ressourcement</em>)</h4>
                    <p>A pioneer of the <em>ressourcement</em> movement, de Lubac co-founded the <em>Sources Chrétiennes</em> series, making the writings of the Church Fathers widely accessible. He also championed a return to the fourfold spiritual reading of Scripture (literal, allegorical, moral, anagogical), enriching a purely historical-critical method. This work was instrumental in the development of <em>Dei Verbum</em>, the council's document on Divine Revelation.</p>

                <h3>An Enduring Legacy</h3>
                <p>Henri de Lubac was a "man of the Church" in the deepest sense. He suffered for his ideas but was ultimately vindicated because his work was not a radical break but a profound recovery of the Church's deepest traditions. He taught the Church how to speak to the modern world not by abandoning its identity, but by rediscovering it.</p>
